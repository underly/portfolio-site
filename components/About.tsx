				After graduating with a degree in{' '}
				<span className="font-medium">Computer Science</span>, I decided to
				pursue my passion for web programming after taking some web-related
				elective courses during my final year. I started learning{' '}
				<span className="font-medium">frontend web development</span> and
				working on personal projects, utilizing the latest technologies i
				saw that were being used in the industry.{' '}
				<span className="italic">One of the best parts of programming</span>{' '}
				is the problem-solving aspect. I love being challenged and the
				feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem, especially
				when working with new frameworks, that tends to happen a lot ðŸ˜‚.
				Although I am experienced in frontend technologies, I have started
				learning backend technologies. My core stack is{' '}
				<span className="font-medium">
					React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB
				</span>
				. I am also familiar with{' '}
				<span className="font-medium">TypeScript and Express</span>. I am
				always looking to learn new technologies. I am currently looking for
				a <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a
				software developer.

				<span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy playing
